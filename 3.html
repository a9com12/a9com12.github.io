<h2>WEAPONS</h2>
<p>In Cyberpunk 2077, weapons are used to neutralize enemies. There are 9 ranged weapon types (Pistols, Revolvers, Assault Rifles, Submachine Guns, Light Machine Guns, Heavy Machine Guns, Shotguns, Precision Rifles, Sniper Rifles) with 3 archetypes (Power, Tech, Smart) and 7 melee weapons (Two-handed clubs, Hammers, Long Blades, One-handed Clubs, Katanas, Knives) with 2 archetypes (Sharp, Blunt). There are also throwable Grenades. Each weapon (except utility grenades) also deals at least one of 4 damage types; Chemical, Electrical, Physical and Thermal Damage. Enemies can also be incapacitated instead of killed by non-lethal weapons, though lethal weapons have this ability as well if they don't damage enemy weakpoints or are equipped with a PAX modification.Weapons are manufactured by 12 corporations in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. Weapons availability are based on the class of weapons of the manufactures. </p>Each manufacture is under either Lower, Middle, or Upper Tier. The higher the tier the more rare and expensive the weapons are.

Modern weapons are classified into 3 main types. Power weapons are conventional guns in the sense that they use traditional ammo, calibers and cartridges. This category includes a wide variety of weapons including polymer one shots, which are disposable, revolvers, smgs, machine guns, shotguns and pistols. High rate of fire accompanied by high recoil is a feature of most power weapons.

Tech weapons are weapons that use rail gun technology, firing projectiles that are propelled with an electromagnetic charge. What they give up in terms of rate of fire, they make up for in penetration effects depending on how long the charge is held for. These weapons use caseless ammunition, typically jacketed steel flechette.

Smart weapons use gyrojet technology to fire caseless guided ammo at enemies. This technology was first developed in the 1960s, but was unreliable during combat. In 2077, they are efficient and pin point accurate. Smart weapons are tied to weapon grips and optics to accurately scan and track the movement of targets.</body></html>
