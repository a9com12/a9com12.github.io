<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>Released in 1988, the first Cyberpunk game, Cyberpunk 2013 introduced players to the world of the dark future. Three supplementary books were released, fleshing out the world and character roles.

In 1990, a second edition was released, titled Cyberpunk 2020, the timeline was moved forward 7 years to the year 2020. As a result much of the information from 2013 was greatly expanded upon, the setting of Night City became real and many of the corporations were given full backstories.</p>

<p>In 1993, the timeline was again pushed forward by another 7 years with CyberGeneration. CyberGeneration focused on supernatural abilities in a more dangerous world. The CyberGeneration series then turned into a spin-off in an alternate reality.

In 1997, the Firestorm books were published. These two—originally three—adventure books were meant to introduce the concept of the Fourth Corporate War to the player and move the story forward into the late 2020s-30s. The campaign pitched the player up against Arasaka, but with the help of many of the named characters throughout the series such as Morgan Blackhand and Johnny Silverhand. A third Firestorm book was planned but eventually became part of the Cyberpunk V3.0 rule book.

In 2005, Cyberpunk v3.0 was published. The timeline was pushed into the 2030s and was a direct followup to the events of the Firestorm series. In 3.0, the world had to deal with the fallout of the Fourth Corporate War and the Arasaka nuke in Night City, and the data corruption on the Net. Reviews were negative based on the setting change as well as some of the presentation elements in the book.</p>

In 2013, Polish video game developer CDProjektRed announced they had acquired the licence to develop video games based on the Cyberpunk series with creator Mike Pondsmith working closely with the Polish studio. Cyberpunk 2077 would move the timeline much further into the year 2077. The game had a full reveal in 2018, with players assuming the role of V, a lowly cyberpunk in Night City.

Mike Pondsmith later announced Cyberpunk Red, a new edition of the pen & paper RPG set sometime before 2077. As a result of the Red Edition and 2077, the timeline was significantly changed. Creator Mike Pondsmith has said the official timeline is up in the air in regards to the later editions. As such, elements of the Firestorm books and the Cyberpunk v3.0 books have been retired, though which elements are currently unknown.

With the release of the Cyberpunk RED Jumpstart kit, it is revealed that the Fourth Corporate War, the crash of the net, and the Arasaka mini-nuke events all canonically occur. The World Book places the Fourth Corporate War as starting in 2021 but becoming official in 2022. The crash of the net is caused by the DataKrash virus, triggered by a dead man switch activated with the death of Rache Bartmoss, which happens in 2022. The Arasaka mini-nuke event is referred to as the "Night City Holocaust" and is shown to take place in 2023.
